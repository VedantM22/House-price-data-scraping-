# House-price-data-scraping-
Here, the primary goal was to demonstrate how we can use scraping libraries to collect data from the real world and then use that data for additional analysis.

The libraries which were used for scraping were beautiful soup , requests. All the data was scraped and then stored in a csv format which can be used later.
